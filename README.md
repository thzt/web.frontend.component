web.frontend.component
======================

## **Big picture**

Here are some commonly used web-frontend components.

In [/library](https://github.com/thzt/web.frontend.component/tree/master/library) directory, there are some pure javascript libs.

In [/jqueryplugin](https://github.com/thzt/web.frontend.component/tree/master/jqueryplugin) directory, there are some plugins based on jquery.

## **Dependency**

About "underscore", it is a library provided some functional-style methods,

some operations on set would be simplified by using it.

About "/bootstrap" "/bootstrap-datetimepicker" "/jquerymobile" "/webuploader", 

only a few libs depend on them, I write xxx-wrapper to encapsulate them.

such as [modalwrapper](https://github.com/thzt/web.frontend.component/tree/master/jqueryplugin/modalwrapper) encapsulated bootstrap modaldialog,

[datepickerwrapper](https://github.com/thzt/web.frontend.component/tree/master/jqueryplugin/datepickerwrapper) capsulated datetimepicker.

Why do I create these wrappers, you can see chinese blog:

## **Modularization**

Dealing with each lib, I put all its utilities in one folder.

Most of libs, I create test-xxx.html to show the use-case of them separately.

## **More about jquery plugins**

As you see, there would be so many jqueryplugins in real world project.

So I create a library to manage them: [pluginmanager](https://github.com/thzt/web.frontend.component/tree/master/library/pluginmanager)

**Therefore I can write plugins in an uniform way.**

For more details, you can see [testpluginmanager.html](https://github.com/thzt/web.frontend.component/blob/master/library/pluginmanager/testpluginmanager.html) in its own folder,

or chinese blogs:
